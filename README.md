    <li>Go to the deployed app on <a href="https://splopple-music.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a></li>
    <li>On page load, the user will be prompted with a search bar </li>
    <li>Insert an Apple or Spotify playlist url.</li>
    <li>A new playlist of the other music service will be crated</li>
    <li>Tracks will be added to the playlist. The user will see each track that has been added. Any tracks that fail will notify the user. </li>
    <li>The user will also get a button that will redirect them to the new playlist on the music service </li>
</ol>

## User-Story
 As a user, I want to be able to convert a playlist from Apply Music into Spotify, or convert a playlist from Spotify into Apple Music. Then I can share the newly created playlist url with others.
